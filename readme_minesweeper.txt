Assignment: Project 3 - Minesweeper

Note: The flag icon/button works as instructed and as intended, but be mindful of when you are in flag mode vs not in flag mode.

What works:
-Minesweeper works as it should. 
-timer
-toggle button to change difficulty => changes the size of the board and number of mines on the grid
-flag icon to mark tiles
-icon to reveal all tiles
-icon to reveal all tiles in grid
-table is populated with game size, length of time that the user spent on the game, and game outcome

What does not work:
-There is no start menu and the timer does not wait for the user to start before counting up. I included buttons above the grid to change the grid size
-when the user clicks on a 0 value tile, the program does not automatically reveal all adjacent 0 value tiles.
